    <h2>House Blend Coffe</h2>
    <img src="images/4.jpg">
    <pre style="font-family:Times new roman;">Coffee is consumed worldwide – the industry ranges from the growth, production, and distribution. There 
are so many different blends, brands, and beans that it can be difficult to understand what can make each 
cup of coffee different from the other. A blend of coffee is the result of combining two different beans 
to produce different flavors and strengths. Blends are not standardized in the coffee industry, making it 
difficult to fully grasp the core differences between cups. In order to define a House Blend coffee, you 
must first understand the basic components of roasting coffee..</pre>

    <h2>French Roast</h2>
    <img src="images/2.jpg">
    <pre style="font-family:Times new roman;">French roast coffee is one of many coffee roasts named for a regional roasting style. It was popular 
throughout much of Europe around the turn of the 19th century. Today, the term is used most often when 
describing almost any dark-roasted coffee. Sometimes, French roast coffee is also referred to (colorfully) 
as Turkish roast, (incorrectly) as Espresso roast, or (simplistically) as Dark roast. Trivia Time: Other 
regional roasts include New England roast coffee, Spanish roast coffee, Italian roast coffee, American roast 
coffee, and Vienna roast coffee.</pre>

    <h2>Columbian Roast</h2>
    <img src="images/5.jpg">
    <pre style="font-family:Times new roman;">Colombian coffee is coffee that has been grown in the various departments within Colombia. It is not 
its own variety of coffee bean. Colombian coffee is prized for its excellent flavour and aroma as almost 
all the coffee grown is of the arabica variety. Coffee packets that have been labelled as Colombian coffee 
may be a blend of various coffees from throughout Colombia or a single origin. Single-origin Colombian coffee 
is coffee that has been produced by and traceable from one single farm or cooperative in Colombia.</pre>
